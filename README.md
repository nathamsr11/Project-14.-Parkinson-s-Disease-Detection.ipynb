Data Set Information: This dataset is composed of a range of biomedical voice measurements from 31 people, 23 with Parkinson's disease (PD). Each column in the table is a particular voice measure, and each row corresponds to one of 195 voice recordings from these individuals ("name" column). The main aim of the data is to discriminate healthy people from those with PD, according to the "status" column which is set to 0 for healthy and 1 for PD.  Attribute Information:  Matrix column entries (attributes):  name - ASCII subject name and recording number  MDVP:Fo(Hz) - Average vocal fundamental frequency  MDVP:Fhi(Hz) - Maximum vocal fundamental frequency  MDVP:Flo(Hz) - Minimum vocal fundamental frequency  MDVP:Jitter(%) , MDVP:Jitter(Abs) , MDVP:RAP , MDVP:PPQ , Jitter:DDP - Several measures of variation in fundamental frequency  MDVP:Shimmer , MDVP:Shimmer(dB) , Shimmer:APQ3 , Shimmer:APQ5 , MDVP:APQ , Shimmer:DDA - Several measures of variation in amplitude  NHR , HNR - Two measures of ratio of noise to tonal components in the voice  status - Health status of the subject (one) - Parkinson's, (zero) - healthy  RPDE , D2 - Two nonlinear dynamical complexity measures  DFA - Signal fractal scaling exponent  spread1 , spread2 , PPE - Three nonlinear measures of fundamental  frequency variation
